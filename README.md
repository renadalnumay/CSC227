# CSC227 Memory Management Project
This Java program is designed to manage a contiguous region of memory using a fixed-size partition scheme. It allows users to allocate and de-allocate memory blocks, and provides a status report about the current state of memory. The allocation of memory blocks can be performed using one of three contiguous memory allocation approaches: first-fit, best-fit, or worst-fit.
